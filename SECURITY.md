We deeply appreciate any effort to discover and disclose security vulnerabilities responsibly.

If you would like to report a vulnerability in one of our products, or have any security concerns with HashiCorp software, please e-mail security@hashicorp.com.

For non-critical matters, we prefer customers open a ticket with the appropriate product. In order for us to best investigate your request, please include any of the following when reporting:

    Proof of concept
    Any tools, including versions used
    Tool output

We take all disclosures very seriously and will do our best to rapidly respond and verify the vulnerability before taking the necessary steps to fix it. After our initial reply to your disclosure, which should be directly after receiving it, we will periodically update you with the status of the fix.
